😄 I’m looking to collaborate on many interesting projects when i´m ready to work with it!

⚡ I started from zero knowledge of this area and i´m working hard every day to learn all the concepts and explore the deep world of development.

✨ I´m also studying in a bootcamp! Here is where i´m learning to code and many other things to improve on my skills as a coder!! Now working with HTML, CSS, and soon with JavaScript.
